# TwentyTwentyTwentyRule
C# Application to encourage taking breaks and reducing eye strain

Different Modes:

1. Notification Mode: Will pop up a notification after a certain amount of time. This notification can be customized with images and phrases.  Every time the notification displays it will choose a random image and random phrase.

2. Lock Mode: Instead of receiving a notification window, your comnputer will be locked and you will need to sign in. This is particularly good for people who need a way to enforce rather than just encourage breaks.
